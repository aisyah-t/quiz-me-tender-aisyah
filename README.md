# Quiz Me Tender

[Quiz Me Tender](http://quiz-me-tender.herokuapp.com/) is a pub quiz app.

It was built using Express, React, Redux and Node.js and pulls a random set of questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) public API.

This was a group project at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), built in 2 days by:
